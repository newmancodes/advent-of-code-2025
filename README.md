# Advent of Code 2025

[![CI](https://github.com/newmancodes/advent-of-code-2025/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/newmancodes/advent-of-code-2025/actions/workflows/main.yml)

From [the Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about):

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

I use it for fun. This year, we'll be using [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) to attack these puzzles. As this is for learning purposes I have not used any form of AI to complete the tasks, though I do ask for recommendations after solving to help me identify and apply more idiomatic solutions to the problems.

## The Puzzles

Each day for the first 12 days of December 2025, a new puzzle will be released. As I attempt them, I shall record how many stars I've gotten.
