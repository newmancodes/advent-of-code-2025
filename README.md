# Advent of Code 2025

From [the Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about):

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

I use it for fun. This year, we'll be using [Go](https://go.dev/) to attack these puzzles. As this is for learning purposes I have not used any form of AI to complete the tasks.
